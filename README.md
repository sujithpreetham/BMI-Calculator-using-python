# BMI-Calculator-using-python
BMI is a measure of relative weight based on an individualâ€™s mass and height. Today, Body Mass Index is commonly used to classify people as underweight, overweight, and even with obesity. Also, it is adopted by countries to promote healthy eating.
Developed a Python-based BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator project aimed at promoting health awareness by providing users with an instant assessment of their BMI.
The system prompts users to input their height and weight, calculates the BMI using the provided information, and evaluates the user's health status.
Utilizes Python's simplicity to create an accessible and user-friendly interface for input and output.
Offers personalized health advice based on the calculated BMI, providing users with actionable insights for maintaining or improving their health.
The project not only calculates BMI but also serves as an educational tool, raising awareness about the significance of BMI in assessing one's health.
Aims to empower users with valuable information about their health and encourage healthier lifestyle choices.
Developed with a focus on user engagement and clear communication of health-related information.
The BMI Calculator project aligns with the broader goal of promoting health consciousness and well-being through technology.
